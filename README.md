# Emperor-lang

This is the home-page of the Emperor project, which aims to create the language, 'emperor,' and surrounding support tools.

The following are links to the various documentation sites generated from work on this project.

- [`emperor`](./docs/emperor/index.html), the compiler for the Emperor language
- [`emperor-base`](./docs/emperor-base/index.html), the base library for the Emperor language (upon which compiler assumptions may be based)
